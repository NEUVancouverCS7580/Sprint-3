# Canoe Rampage (v3) â€“ MVP Demo Documentation

## Description:

The Canoe Rampage MVP demo is a simplified version of an extensible two-word canoe mobile game where the player navigates a canoe downstream, earning points by avoiding collisions with rocks. The primary goal is to create a basic and engaging experience that focuses on the core gameplay mechanics. Additional feature for end build would aims to enable players to control the game using voice commands through voice recognition technology.

## Purpose of the Game:

To serve as an aid for teaching language, especially for reclamation of endangered languages.
